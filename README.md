## Reasons for taking this course
I am *very* technologically challenged. I learned much later compared to my peers how to capture an image on my phone. The following are the few things that I am able to do using my computer:

- search on Google
- read and send e-mail
- use word and powerpoint 
- watch Youtube videos

However, I realize that in the 21st century, I would be a much more attractive candidate in both the job market and academia if I knew how to use a programming tool. (I do not even know if that is what you call programs like R, Stata, python etc.) So, in an attempt to become a more 21st century type employee, I committed to taking this course for my last quarter in MAPSS.
